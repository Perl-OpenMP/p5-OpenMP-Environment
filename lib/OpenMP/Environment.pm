=head1 NAME

OpenMP::Environment - Perl extension managing OpenMP variables in
C<%ENV> within a script.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenMP::Environment ();
  my $env = OpenMP::Environment->new;
  $env->assert_omp_environment;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides accessors for affecting the OpenMP/GOMP environmental
variables that affect some aspects of OpenMP programs and shared
libraries at libary load and run times.

This module is not directly useful with L<Inline::C> and L<Alien::OpenMP>,
but can be. See L<Example 5> for more information on how to
achieve this utility.

There are setters, getters, and unsetters for all published OpenMP
(and GOMP) environmental variables, in additional to some utility
methods.

C<The environment variables which beginning with OMP_ are defined
by section 4 of the OpenMP specification in version 4.5, while
those beginning with GOMP_ are GNU extensions.>

=head1 ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

Most provided methods are meant to manipulate a particular OpenMP
environmental variable. Each has a setter, getter, and unsetter
(i.e., deletes the variable from C<%ENV> directly.

Each method is documented, and it is noted if the setter will
validate the provided value. Validation occurs whenever the set of
values is a simple numerical value or is a limited set of specific
strings. It is clearly noted below when a setter does not validate.
This is extended to C<assert_omp_environment>, which will validate
the variables it is able if they are already set in C<%ENV>.

L<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/Environment-Variables.html>

=head1 USES AND USE CASES

=head2 BENCHMARKS

This module is ideal to support benchmarks and test suites that
are implemented using OpenMP. As a small example, there is an
example of such a script, in C<benchmarks/demo-dc-NASA.pl> that
shows the building and execution of the C<DC> benchmark. Distributed
with this source is are the C and Fortran protions of NASA's NPB
(version 3.4.1) benchmarking suite for OpenMP. It's okay, technically
I in addition to all US Citizens own this code since we paid for
it :). The link to the benchmark suite is
L<https://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html>, but it is one
of many such OpenMP benchmarks and validation suites.

=head2 SUPPORTING XS MODULES USING OPENMP

The caveats for linking shared libraries that contain OpenMP are
explained in C<Example 4> above. The C<OpenMP::Environment> module
is not as effect as it is with stand alone executables that use
OpenMP; but the can be made so with some minor modifications to
the code that provide additional support for passing number of
threads, etc and using the OpenMP API (e.g., C<omp_set_num_threads>)
to affect the number of threads.

=head1 EXAMPLES

There is a growing set of example scripts in the distribution's,
C<examples/> directory.

The number and breadth of testing is also growing, so for more
examples on using it and this module's flexibility; please see
those.

Lastly, the Section L<SUPPORTED C<OpenMP> ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES>
provides the full description of each environmental variable
available in the OpenMP and GOMP documentation. It also describes
the range of values that are deemed C<valid> for each variable.

=head2 Example 1

Ensure an OpenMP environment is set up properly already (externally)

  use OpenMP::Environment;
  my $env = OpenMP::Environment->new;
  $env->assert_omp_environment;

=head2 Example 2

Managing a range of thread scales (useful for benchmarking, testing, etc)

    use OpenMP::Environment;
    my $env = OpenMP::Environment->new;
  
    foreach my $i (1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256) {
      $env->set_omp_num_threads($i); # Note: validated
      my $exit_code = system(qw{/path/to/my_prog_r --opt1 x --opt2 y});
       
      if ($exit_code == 0) {
        # ... do some post processing
      }
      else {
        # ... handle failed execution
      }
    }

=head2 Example 3

Extended benchmarking, affecting C<OMP_SCHEDULE> in addition toC<OMP_NUM_THREADS>.

    use OpenMP::Environment;
    my $env = OpenMP::Environment->new;
  
    foreach my $i (1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256) {
      $env->set_omp_num_threads($i); # Note: validated
      foreach my $sched (qw/static dynamic auto/) {
        # compute chunk size
        my $chunk = get_baby_ruth($i);
        
        # set schedule using prescribed format
        $env->set_omp_schedule(qq{$sched;$chunk}); # Note: Not validated
        
        my $exit_code = system(qw{/path/to/my_prog_r --opt1 x --opt2 y});
         
        if ($exit_code == 0) {
          # ... do some post processing
        }
        else {
          # ... handle failed execution
        }
      }
    }

Note: While it has not been tested, theoretically any Perl module
that utilizes compiled libraries (via C::Inline, XS, FFIs, etc)
that are C<OpenMP> aware should also be at home within the context
of this module.

=head2 Example 4

Use with an XS module that itself is C<OpenMP> aware:

Note: OpenMP::Environment has no effect on Perl interfaces that
utilize compiled code as shared objects, that also contain OpenMP
constructs.

The reason for this is that OpenMP implemented by compilers, gcc
(gomp), anyway, only read in the environment once. In our use of
Inline::C, this corresponds to the actual loading of the .so that
is linked to the XS-based Perl interface it presents.  As a result,
a developer must use the OpenMP API that is exposed. In the example
below, we're using the C<omp_set_num_threads> rather than setting
C<OMP_NUM_THREADS> via %ENV or using OpenMP::Environment's
C<omp_num_threads> method.

This example uses OpenMP::Environment, but shows that it works with
two caveats:

=over 4

=item It must be called in a C<BEGIN> block that contains the
invocation of C<Inline::C>

=item It as only this single opportunity to effect the variables
that it sets

    }

L<Example 5> in the following section demostrates how get around this
restriction somewhat. The caveat is that the respective environmental
variable must also come with a corresponding I<setter> function in the
OpenMP run time.

=head2 Example 5

Writing C functions that are aware of the OpenMP run time methods
that are able to be affected by the set of C<omp_set_*> functions:

The following is an example of emulating the familiar behavior of
compiled OpenMP programs that respect a number of environmental
variables at run time. The key difference between running a compiled
OpenMP program at the commandline and a compiled subroutine in Perl
that utilizes OpenMP, is that subsequent calls to the subroutine
in the Perl script do not have an opportunity to relead the binary
or shared library.

The "user experience" of one running an OpenMP program from the
shell is that it the number of threads used in the program may be
set implicitly using the OMP_NUM_THREADS environmental variable.
Therefore, one may run the binary in a shell loop and update
C<OMP_NUM_THREADS> environmentally.

    # build and load subroutines
    use Inline (
        C           => 'DATA',
        name        => q{Test},
        ccflagsex   => q{-fopenmp},
        lddlflags   => join( q{ }, $Config::Config{lddlflags}, q{-fopenmp} ),
        BUILD_NOISY => 1,
    );
    
    my $oenv = OpenMP::Environment->new;
    for my $num_threads (qw/1 2 4 8 16 24/) {
        $oenv->omp_num_threads($num_threads);
        test();
    }
    
    __DATA__
    
    __C__
    #include <omp.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
     
    void test() {
      _ENV_set_num_threads();
      #pragma omp parallel
      {
        if (0 == omp_get_thread_num())
          printf("%-2d threads\n", omp_get_num_threads()); 
      }
    }
        
    void _ENV_set_num_threads() {
      char *num;
      num = getenv("OMP_NUM_THREADS");
      omp_set_num_threads(atoi(num));
    }

OpenMP benchmarks are often written in this fashion. It is possible
to affect the number of threads in the binary, but only through
the use of run time methods. In the case of C<OMP_NUM_THREADS>,
this function is C<omp_set_num_threads>. The issue here is that
using run time setters breaks the veil that is so attractive about
OpenMP; the pragmas offer a way to implicitly define OpenMP threads
*if* the compiler can recognize them; if it can't, the pragmas are
designed to appear as normal comments.

Using run time functions is an explicit act, and therefore can't
be hidden in the same manner. This requires the compiler to link
against OpenMP run time libraries, even if there is no intention
to run in parallel. There are 2 options here - hide the run time
call from the compiler using C<ifdef> or the like; or link the
OpenMP library and just ensure C<OMP_NUM_THREADS> is set to C<1>
(as in a single thread).

Using C<OpenMP::Environment> introduces the consideration that the
compiled subroutine is loaded only once when the Perl script is
executed. It is true that in this situation, the environment is
read in as expected - but, it is only considered I<once> and at
library I<load> time.

To get away from this restriction and emulate more closely the
C<user experience> of the commandline with respect to OpenMP
environmental variable controls, we present the following example
to show how to C<re-read> certain environmental variables.

Interestingly, there are only 6 run time I<setters> that correspond
to OpenMP environmental variables to work with:

=over 4

=item C<omp_set_num_threads>

Corresponds to C<omp_set_num_threads>.

=item C<omp_set_default_device>

Corresponds to C<OMP_DEFAULT_DEVICE>

=item C<omp_set_dynamic>

Corresponds to C<OMP_DYNAMIC>.

=item C<omp_set_max_active_levels>

Corresponds to C<OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS>

=item C<omp_set_nested>

=item C<omp_set_schedule>

Corresponds to C<OMP_SCHEDULE>.

=head1 METHODS

B<Note:> Due to the libary load time of functions compiled and
exported (e.g., using L<Inline::C>), only environmental variables
that are provided with a standard I<set> function for affecting at
run time can be made to emulate the effective behavior that those
familiar with executing OpenMP binaries my find familiar. See
examples 4 and 5 above for more information about what this means.

=head1 SUPPORTED C<OpenMP> ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

The following is essentially direct copy from the URL in DESCRIPTION:

=over 3

=item C<OMP_CANCELLATION>

If set to TRUE, the cancellation is activated. If set to FALSE or
if unset, cancellation is disabled and the cancel construct is
ignored.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_DISPLAY_ENV>

If set to TRUE, the OpenMP version number and the values associated
with the OpenMP environment variables are printed to stderr. If
set to VERBOSE, it additionally shows the value of the environment
variables which are GNU extensions. If undefined or set to FALSE,
this information will not be shown.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_DEFAULT_DEVICE>

Set to choose the device which is used in a target region, unless
the value is overridden by omp_get_set_assert_default_device or by
a device clause. The value shall be the nonnegative device number.
If no device with the given device number exists, the code is
executed on the host. If unset, device number 0 will be used.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_DYNAMIC>

Enable or disable the dynamic adjustment of the number of threads
within a team. The value of this environment variable shall be TRUE
or FALSE. If undefined, dynamic adjustment is disabled by default.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS>

Specifies the initial value for the maximum number of nested parallel
regions. The value of this variable shall be a positive integer.
If undefined, then if OMP_NESTED is defined and set to true, or if
OMP_NUM_THREADS or OMP_PROC_BIND are defined and set to a list with
more than one item, the maximum number of nested parallel regions
will be initialized to the largest number supported, otherwise it
will be set to one.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_MAX_TASK_PRIORITY>

Specifies the initial value for the maximum priority value that
can be set for a task. The value of this variable shall be a
non-negative integer, and zero is allowed. If undefined, the default
priority is 0.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_NESTED>

Enable or disable nested parallel regions, i.e., whether team
members are allowed to create new teams. The value of this environment
variable shall be TRUE or FALSE. If set to TRUE, the number of
maximum active nested regions supported will by default be set to
the maximum supported, otherwise it will be set to one. If
OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS is defined, its setting will override this
setting. If both are undefined, nested parallel regions are enabled
if OMP_NUM_THREADS or OMP_PROC_BINDS are defined to a list with
more than one item, otherwise they are disabled by default.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_NUM_THREADS>

Specifies the default number of threads to use in parallel regions.
The value of this variable shall be a comma-separated list of
positive integers; the value specifies the number of threads to
use for the corresponding nested level. Specifying more than one
item in the list will automatically enable nesting by default. If
undefined one thread per CPU is used.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_PROC_BIND>

Specifies whether threads may be moved between processors. If set
to TRUE, OpenMP theads should not be moved; if set to FALSE they
may be moved. Alternatively, a comma separated list with the values
MASTER, CLOSE and SPREAD can be used to specify the thread affinity
policy for the corresponding nesting level. With MASTER the worker
threads are in the same place partition as the master thread. With
CLOSE those are kept close to the master thread in contiguous place
partitions. And with SPREAD a sparse distribution across the place
partitions is used. Specifying more than one item in the list will
automatically enable nesting by default.

When undefined, OMP_PROC_BIND defaults to TRUE when OMP_PLACES or
GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY is set and FALSE otherwise.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<OMP_PLACES>

The thread placement can be either specified using an abstract name
or by an explicit list of the places. The abstract names threads,
cores and sockets can be optionally followed by a positive number
in parentheses, which denotes the how many places shall be created.
With threads each place corresponds to a single hardware thread;
cores to a single core with the corresponding number of hardware
threads; and with sockets the place corresponds to a single socket.
The resulting placement can be shown by setting the OMP_DISPLAY_ENV
environment variable.

Alternatively, the placement can be specified explicitly as comma
separated list of places. A place is specified by set of nonnegative
numbers in curly braces, denoting the denoting the hardware threads.
The hardware threads belonging to a place can either be specified
as comma separated list of nonnegative thread numbers or using an
interval. Multiple places can also be either specified by a comma
separated list of places or by an interval. To specify an interval,
a colon followed by the count is placed after after the hardware
thread number or the place. Optionally, the length can be followed
by a colon and the stride number - otherwise a unit stride is
assumed. For instance, the following specifies the same places
list: "{0,1,2}, {3,4,6}, {7,8,9}, {10,11,12}"; "{0:3}, {3:3}, {7:3},
{10:3}"; and "{0:2}:4:3".

If OMP_PLACES and GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY are unset and OMP_PROC_BIND is
either unset or false, threads may be moved between CPUs following
no placement policy.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<OMP_STACKSIZE>

Set the default thread stack size in kilobytes, unless the number
is suffixed by B, K, M or G, in which case the size is, respectively,
in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. This is different from
pthread_attr_get_set_assertstacksize which gets the number of bytes
as an argument. If the stack size cannot be set due to system
constraints, an error is reported and the initial stack size is
left unchanged. If undefined, the stack size is system dependent.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<OMP_SCHEDULE>

Allows to specify schedule type and chunk size. The value of the
variable shall have the form: type[,chunk] where type is one of
static, dynamic, guided or auto The optional chunk size shall be
a positive integer. If undefined, dynamic scheduling and a chunk
size of 1 is used.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD>

Specifies the behaviour with regard to offloading code to a device.
This variable can be set to one of three values - MANDATORY, DISABLED
or DEFAULT.

If set to MANDATORY, the program will terminate with an error if
the offload device is not present or is not supported. If set to
DISABLED, then offloading is disabled and all code will run on the
host. If set to DEFAULT, the program will try offloading to the
device first, then fall back to running code on the host if it
cannot.

If undefined, then the program will behave as if DEFAULT was set.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_THREAD_LIMIT>

Specifies the number of threads to use for the whole program. The
value of this variable shall be a positive integer. If undefined,
the number of threads is not limited.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<OMP_WAIT_POLICY>

Specifies whether waiting threads should be active or passive. If
the value is PASSIVE, waiting threads should not consume CPU power
while waiting; while the value is ACTIVE specifies that they should.
If undefined, threads wait actively for a short time before waiting
passively.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY>

Binds threads to specific CPUs. The variable should contain a
space-separated or comma-separated list of CPUs. This list may
contain different kinds of entries: either single CPU numbers in
any order, a range of CPUs (M-N) or a range with some stride (M-N:S).
CPU numbers are zero based. For example, GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY="0 3
1-2 4-15:2" will bind the initial thread to CPU 0, the second to
CPU 3, the third to CPU 1, the fourth to CPU 2, the fifth to CPU
4, the sixth through tenth to CPUs 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 respectively
and then start assigning back from the beginning of the list.
GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=0 binds all threads to CPU 0.

There is no libgomp library routine to determine whether a CPU
affinity specification is in effect. As a workaround,
language-specific library functions, e.g., getenv in C or
GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE in Fortran, may be used to query the
setting of the GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY environment variable. A defined
CPU affinity on startup cannot be changed or disabled during the
run time of the application.

If both GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY and OMP_PROC_BIND are set, OMP_PROC_BIND
has a higher precedence. If neither has been set and OMP_PROC_BIND
is unset, or when OMP_PROC_BIND is set to FALSE, the host system
will handle the assignment of threads to CPUs.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<GOMP_DEBUG>

Enable debugging output. The variable should be set to 0 (disabled,
also the default if not set), or 1 (enabled).

If enabled, some debugging output will be printed during execution.
This is currently not specified in more detail, and subject to
change.

This variable is validated via setter.

=item C<GOMP_STACKSIZE>

Determines how long a threads waits actively with consuming CPU
power before waiting passively without consuming CPU power. The
value may be either INFINITE, INFINITY to always wait actively or
an integer which gives the number of spins of the busy-wait loop.
The integer may optionally be followed by the following suffixes
acting as multiplication factors: k (kilo, thousand), M (mega,
million), G (giga, billion), or T (tera, trillion). If undefined,
0 is used when OMP_WAIT_POLICY is PASSIVE, 300,000 is used when
OMP_WAIT_POLICY is undefined and 30 billion is used when
OMP_WAIT_POLICY is ACTIVE. If there are more OpenMP threads than
available CPUs, 1000 and 100 spins are used for OMP_WAIT_POLICY
being ACTIVE or undefined, respectively; unless the GOMP_SPINCOUNT
is lower or OMP_WAIT_POLICY is PASSIVE.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<GOMP_SPINCOUNT>

Set the default thread stack size in kilobytes. This is different
from pthread_attr_get_set_assertstacksize which gets the number of
bytes as an argument. If the stack size cannot be set due to system
constraints, an error is reported and the initial stack size is
left unchanged. If undefined, the stack size is system dependent.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.

=item C<GOMP_RTEMS_THREAD_POOLS>

This environment variable is only used on the RTEMS real-time
operating system. It determines the scheduler instance specific
thread pools. The format for GOMP_RTEMS_THREAD_POOLS is a list of
optional <thread-pool-count>[$<priority>]@<scheduler-name>
configurations separated by : where:

1. C<thread-pool-count> is the thread pool count for this scheduler
instance.

2. $<priority> is an optional priority for the worker threads of
a thread pool according to pthread_get_set_assertschedparam. In
case a priority value is omitted, then a worker thread will inherit
the priority of the OpenMP master thread that created it. The
priority of the worker thread is not changed after creation, even
if a new OpenMP master thread using the worker has a different
priority.

3. @<scheduler-name> is the scheduler instance name according to
the RTEMS application configuration.

In case no thread pool configuration is specified for a scheduler
instance, then each OpenMP master thread of this scheduler instance
will use its own dynamically allocated thread pool. To limit the
worker thread count of the thread pools, each OpenMP master thread
must call C<set_num_threads>.

This module provides access to, but does NOT validate this variable.
